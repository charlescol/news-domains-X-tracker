# US & International News Domains Twitter Stats Tracker

## **Project Overview**

This project aims to compile a list of major news domains along with their associated X accounts. The repository will also include several algorithms to fetch and analyze real-time statistics related to these X accounts.

While the focus of the project primarily covers the **United States**, it also includes data from other countries. However, at present, the dataset contains a higher volume of data related to US-based news sources.

The current data has been collected from multiple repositories and will be enriched over time.

## **Current Data Sources**

The data currently used in this project has been sourced from the following repositories:

1. [ercexpo/us-news-domains](https://github.com/ercexpo/us-news-domains)
2. [palewire/news-homepages](https://github.com/palewire/news-homepages)

More sources will be added over time.
